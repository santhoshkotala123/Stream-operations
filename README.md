Stream
A stream in java is sequence of data elements that allows you to process collections (like list) in a functional declarative way.
1.	filter: Selects elements that match a given condition.
2.	map: Transforms each element into another form.
3.	Flat Map: Flattens nested collections into a single stream.
4.	distinct: Removes duplicate elements.
5.	sorted: Sorts elements in natural or custom order.
6.	limit: Restricts the stream to the first N elements.
7.	skip: Skips the first N elements.
8.	collect: Converts the stream into a collection or other data type.
9.	For Each: Executes an action for each element.
10.	reduce: Combines elements into a single result.
11.	count: Counts the number of elements.
12.	Any Match: Checks if any element matches a condition.
13.	All Match: Checks if all elements match a condition.
14.	None Match: Checks if no elements match a condition.
15.	Find First: Retrieves the first element.
16.	Find Any: Retrieves any one element, especially useful in parallel streams.
17.	peek: Allows viewing each element without altering the stream.
18.	Parallel Stream: Creates a stream that can process elements concurrently.
